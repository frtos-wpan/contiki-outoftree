# The first sed line removes things related to the 128RFA1, because some
# declarations clash with the rest. The /#e/ matches #endif and #else.
#
# The second line
# - preserves anything beginning with HAL_MAX, i.e., HAL_MAX_FRAME_LENGTH,
# - removes all CPP directives, e.g., the bothersome platform check, and
# - removes all single-line comments, so one can actually read the file
